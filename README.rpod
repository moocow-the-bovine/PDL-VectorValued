=head1 DESCRIPTION

PDL::VectorValued provides some generalizations of builtin PDL
functions to higher order PDLs which treat vectors in the source
PDLs as "data values".

=head1 BUILDING

Build this module as you would any perl module, by doing something
akin to the following:

 gzip -dc distname-XX.YY.tar.gz | tar -xof -
 cd distname-XX.YY/
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test                                     # optional
 make install

See L<perlmodinstall>(1) for details.
